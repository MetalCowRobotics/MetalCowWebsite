                MetalCow Robotics was founded in November 2011 under
                the guidance of McLean County Co-operative Extension
                with founding grants from JCPenney and University of
                Illinois Extension to form a FIRST Robotics team. This
                partnership is an effort to provide new and exciting
                opportunities to local high school youth in McLean,
                Woodford, and Livingston Counties.

                We built Gertrude, our sixth robot in 2017, in honor of Gertrude Warren “The Mother of
                4-H”. Gertrude was capable of performing all aspects of Steamworks which involved
                shooting balls and placing gears, however, we rarely shot balls in competition as the
                game and our strength was placing gears and climbing. Our team remained stable at 24
                members and we participated in two regions. After working through fewer bugs, we
                finished 33rd at the week 3 Central Illinois Regional, which prepared us well for a 20th
                overall ranking week 5 at the Midwest Regional in Chicago where we were picked by the
                3rd seeded alliance and had a chance to win it all and had the top two highest scores, but
                came up short after some unfortunate mechanical problems from tough defense.

                We built our fifth robot, Flank, in 2016. The biggest highlight of this season was moving
                into our new permanent year round home at the Crossroads Center in January at the
                start of our build season. Our team grew to 24 members and we participated in two
                regions. After working through several bugs, we finished 20 th at the week 3 Central
                Illinois Regional, which prepared us well for a 9 th overall ranking week 5 at the Queen’s
                City Regional.

                2015 was our fourth season and the senior year of many
                of our founding members. We started with a large grant
                from State Farm which helped the team purchase more
                tools, laptops, and supplies. We also attracted more
                people bringing the team up to 17 students and several
                new mentors. We participated in three regional
                competitions and as a wild card at World’s. Although we
                did not rank high nor get selected to a week 1 alliance
                in Little Rock, we successfully tweaked our robot in
                preparation for the rest of our season. Following that
                we ended up on 6<sup>th</sup> seeded alliance in Peoria
                and Cincinnati and a top ranked team in our division at
                World’s.

                that could lift over 60 pounds. We also a jump slide
                drive system which consisted of 5 omni-wheels; two on
                each side and one in the middle going sideways. With
                that drive train we were able to precisely move
                sideways to properly align ourselves with field
                elements.

                Recycle Rush is a recycling -themed game played by two
                Alliances of three robots each. Robots score points by
                stacking totes on scoring platforms, capping those
                stacks with recycling containers, and properly
                disposing of pool noodles, representing litter. Totes
                are collected either from the landfill located on the
                far end of the field or from the human player station.
                Ellie was created to work from the human player station
                and can create one six stack of totes with a recycling
                can and litter on top scoring 36 points.

                MetalCow’s third year saw even more success. We
                finished our robot early and designed a robot to
                compete in all phases of the game <i>Aerial Assist.</i>
                Fifteen members competed in the first week of
                competition at the Central Illinois Regional at the
                Pekin, IL AvantiDome and the 4th week of competition at
                the Purdue Boilermaker Regional. Along with our
                Creativity Award for our unique catching design, we
                earned alliance selections on the second seeded
                alliance in Pekin and the number one pick on the top
                seeded alliance at Purdue. More than anything, we had
                proven ourselves as an up and coming veteran team which
                helped secure a large corporate donation to expand our
                program.

                Aerial Assist is a game styled similarly to a over
                -sized basketball game. Robots must either catch or
                pick up 25in diameter exercise balls from the ground or
                from the human player. There are multiple ways to score
                points. A high goal is equal to 10 points and a low
                goal is equal to 1 point. If you pass once you gain an
                extra 10 point for a total of 20 when you score. If you
                pass twice you gain an extra 20 point for a total of 40
                when you score. You are also able to throw the ball
                over a 6 foot tall truss in the middle of the field for
                an immediate 10 points, also if a robot catches the
                ball thrown over the truss you gain another immediate
                10 point bonus.

                Daisy was designed for easy catching and throwing; it
                is able to do this because we extend our sides out for
                a total of 17 square foot catcher which feeds into our
                catapult that has an estimated 150 lbs launch force.
                Daisy has four meccanum wheels which, in theory, allow
                it to move in any direction facing forward except for
                up and down. It is also able to score into the high
                goal or the low goal.

                The team’s second year brought more members and a more
                complex robot. The team had 15 members. This required
                dividing the team members into sub-teams including
                mechanical/powerdrive, programming, marketing and
                logistics. The game was called <i>Ultimate Ascent</i>
                and involved throwing Frisbees at a target and climbing
                a pyramid. We participated at the Crossroads Regional
                in Terre Haute, IN. Although the team didn’t advance to
                the finals, they took great pride in successfully
                executing all the game elements. The team also
                participated in an animation contest with its
                production of <i>Jack and the Beanstalk</i> featuring
                our mascot MetalCow and was awarded the 2013 Award for
                Technical Excellence.

                Ultimate Ascent is a game styled similarly to disc golf
                or ultimate frisbee. Robots must pick up or collect
                disks from feeder stations, and put them into wide
                goals 10′ off the ground. At the end of the game,
                robots can climb a metal pyramid to gain more points,
                with more being awarded for going higher.

                Chippy was designed with a dropout 2 -pneumatic, 2
                -omni wheel drive -train that enabled us to quickly
                service problems, as well as maneuver and drive quickly
                on the field. We use two pneumatic wheels that launch
                the disk out into the top goal. At the end of the game,
                we would latch two hooks on our shooter to the bottom
                bar to pull up off &nbsp;the ground for a 10 point
                bonus.

                The team of 11 members spent 6 weeks in
                January/February 2012 building a robot to play in the
                2012 FIRST <i>Rebound Rumble</i> game. The robot was
                designed to shoot a basketball into the goal, play
                defense, and balance on a bridge. The first competition
                was at the Midwest Regional on March 2012 held at the
                UIC Pavilion in Chicago, IL. The goal going into the
                competition as a rookie team was to have a running
                robot. We arrived at the competition with two bags of
                partially completed assemblies and left with a fully
                functioning robot that earned us the Rookie Inspiration
                Award for our efforts and determination to continually
                build and modify at this competition.

                Rebound Rumble is a game styled similarly to
                basketball. Robots must collect basketballs and score
                them into goals of varying heights (More points for
                higher goals). Separating the two sides of the field
                are 3 teeter -totter “bridges”, and a bump. At the end
                of the game, 10 points are given for each robot
                balanced on a bridge.

                Bessie was designed to pick up and score balls into the
                low goal, and be able to push down the bridge so it
                could balance on and travel across.
