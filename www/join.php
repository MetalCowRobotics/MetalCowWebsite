              <p>
                MetalCow Robotics Team 4213 is 4-H Club which competes in FIRST Robotics Competition.
                We are non-profit organization promoting science and technology education in our community.
                As a community-based team our students come from public, private, and
                homeschool students.

</p>
                As a student on MetalCow Robotics you will work side-by-side with industry professionals
                from local companies and businesses to design and build a 120 lb. robot in six weeks.
                We have activities and meet year round. However, the build-season starts in early January
                and goes to about mid-March.
