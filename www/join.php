              <p>
                MetalCow Robotics Team 4213 is 4-H Club which competes in FIRST Robotics Competition.
                We are non-profit organization promoting science and technology education in our community.
                As a community-based team our students come from public, private, and
                homeschool students.
              </p>
                As a student on MetalCow Robotics you will work side-by-side with industry professionals
                from local companies and businesses to design and build a 120 lb. robot in six weeks.
                We have activities and meet year round. However, the build-season starts in early January
                and goes to about mid-March.
              </p>

                        <p>The build team performs the manufacturing of the robot. They create and
                          maintain the physical aspect of the robots. Students learn proper build safety,
                          how to turn CAD plans into a physical object, electrical, and basic metal work
                          skills. Students with an interest in mechanical design, electrical work or a
                          passion for hands on creation would thrive in the immersive build experience
                          offered by MetalCow Robotics and the FIRST program.</p>

                            the goals as seamlessly as possible and creates plans to give to the build team to
                            turn into the actual robot. Students interested in architecture, design or
                            mechanical design would benefit from learning these skills in a fun and safe

                            soldering to create the control system that brings life to the robot. Working as a
                            team students will program the robot to run autonomously as well as create a system
                            to be operated by a driver. They also have opportunities to create apps or build
