                <div class="col-md-6">
                  <p>MetalCow Robotics, FIRST team 4213 was founded in December of 2011. From
                    the start the team was partnered with 4-H in McLean County Illinois. The
                    team started as a team of 11 that met in a barn on a local pumpkin farm.
                    The first year culminated in the Rookie Inspiration Award. Over the
                    next 3 years the team grew to a team of 17 wining a award for animation
                    and earning top seeded alliance spots and a visit to the FIRST World
                    championship. 2016 and 2017 brought a new year round location in a local
                    shopping center and an increase to 24 members in 2016. The 2018 FIRST
                    season brought yet another move to Riven Automotive.
                  <p>FIRST is a world wide organization whoâ€™s mission is to promote
                    science, technology, engineering, and leadership. FIRST offers programs for
                    students elementary age to high school. MetalCow Robotics is part of the
                    capstone program called FRC or First Robotics Competition. This program
                    involves creating 120 pound robot in a six week time constraint that is
                     used to compete in 3 day long competitions with other teams from around
                     the world. Each challenge is complex allowing for teams to create a unique
                     robot to accomplish the challenge. </p>
                  <p>4-H is a national organization for students 8 to 18 promoting
                    personal development, skill building, teamwork and leadership. McLean
                    County where MetalCow Robotics is based has the largest 4-H fair.
                    Students are encouraged in skills such as cooking, art, sewing,
                    agriculture, and technology.</p>




                  <p>As a student on MetalCow Robotics you will work side-by-side with industry professionals
                  from local companies and businesses to design and build a 120 lb. robot in six weeks.
                  We have activities and meet year round. However, the build-season starts in early January
                  and goes to about mid-March.</p>

                  <p>Our mission is to promote science, technology, and engineering in the community while helping
                    students gain real world skills they can use for the rest of their lives.
                  MetalCow Robotics is a 4-H SPIN club that participates in FIRST Robotics Competitions.
                  But, it is much more than robotics; it is a small business where members learn digital media,
                  advertising, web design, public speaking, business skills, and leadership.<p>

                  <p>The team is made up of students ages 13 to 18 from the McLean county area.  We manage the business
                  of the team and create robots from the ground up.  Our members come from all walks of life which
                  provides a  great opportunity to learn how to work together on a common goal.  We have adult mentors
                  from the  community who volunteer their time and professional expertise to help develop the next
                  generation of leaders.</p>
