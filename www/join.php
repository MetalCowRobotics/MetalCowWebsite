                  As a student on MetalCow Robotics you will work side-by-side with industry professionals
                  from local companies and businesses to design and build a 120 lb. robot in six weeks.
                  We have activities and meet year round. However, the build-season starts in early January
                  and goes to about mid-March.

                  Our mission is to promote science, technology, and engineering in the community while helping
                   students gain real world skills they can use for the rest of their lives.
                  MetalCow Robotics is a 4-H SPIN club that participates in FIRST Robotics Competitions.
                  But, it is much more than robotics; it is a small business where members learn digital media,
                  advertising, web design, public speaking, business skills, and leadership.

                  The team is made up of students ages 13 to 18 from the McLean county area.  We manage the business
                  of the team and create robots from the ground up.  Our members
                  come from all walks of life which provides a  great opportunity to learn how to work together
                  on a common goal.  We have adult mentors from the  community who volunteer their time and
                  professional expertise to help develop the next generation of leaders.

                          maintain the physical aspect of the robots. Students learn proper build safety,
                          how to turn CAD plans into a physical object, electrical, and basic metal work
                          skills. Students with an interest in mechanical design, electrical work or a
                          passion for hands on creation would thrive in the immersive build experience
                          offered by MetalCow Robotics and the FIRST program.</p>
