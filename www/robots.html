                        MetalCow Robotics was founded in November 2011 under
                        the guidance of McLean County Co-operative Extension
                        with founding grants from JCPenney and University of
                        Illinois Extension to form a FIRST Robotics team. This
                        partnership is an effort to provide new and exciting
                        opportunities to local high school youth in McLean,
                        Woodford, and Livingston Counties.

                        2015 was our fourth season and the senior year of many
                        of our founding members. We started with a large grant
                        from State Farm which helped the team purchase more
                        tools, laptops, and supplies. We also attracted more
                        people bringing the team up to 17 students and several
                        new mentors. We participated in three regional
                        competitions and as a wild card at World’s. Although we
                        did not rank high nor get selected to a week 1 alliance
                        in Little Rock, we successfully tweaked our robot in
                        preparation for the rest of our season. Following that
                        we ended up on 6<sup>th</sup> seeded alliance in Peoria
                        and Cincinnati and a top ranked team in our division at
                        World’s.

                        in mind. We had two lead screws to elevate the arms
                        that could lift over 60 pounds. We also a jump slide
                        drive system which consisted of 5 omni-wheels; two on
                        each side and one in the middle going sideways. With
                        that drive train we were able to precisely move
                        sideways to properly align ourselves with field
                        elements.

                        Recycle Rush is a recycling -themed game played by two
                        Alliances of three robots each. Robots score points by
                        stacking totes on scoring platforms, capping those
                        stacks with recycling containers, and properly
                        disposing of pool noodles, representing litter. Totes
                        are collected either from the landfill located on the
                        far end of the field or from the human player station.
                        Ellie was created to work from the human player station
                        and can create one six stack of totes with a recycling
                        can and litter on top scoring 36 points.

                        MetalCow’s third year saw even more success. We
                        finished our robot early and designed a robot to
                        compete in all phases of the game <i>Aerial Assist.</i>
                        Fifteen members competed in the first week of
                        competition at the Central Illinois Regional at the
                        Pekin, IL AvantiDome and the 4th week of competition at
                        the Purdue Boilermaker Regional. Along with our
                        Creativity Award for our unique catching design, we
                        earned alliance selections on the second seeded
                        alliance in Pekin and the number one pick on the top
                        seeded alliance at Purdue. More than anything, we had
                        proven ourselves as an up and coming veteran team which
                        helped secure a large corporate donation to expand our
                        program.

                        Aerial Assist is a game styled similarly to a over
                        -sized basketball game. Robots must either catch or
                        pick up 25in diameter exercise balls from the ground or
                        from the human player. There are multiple ways to score
                        points. A high goal is equal to 10 points and a low
                        goal is equal to 1 point. If you pass once you gain an
                        extra 10 point for a total of 20 when you score. If you
                        pass twice you gain an extra 20 point for a total of 40
                        when you score. You are also able to throw the ball
                        over a 6 foot tall truss in the middle of the field for
                        an immediate 10 points, also if a robot catches the
                        ball thrown over the truss you gain another immediate
                        10 point bonus.

                        Daisy was designed for easy catching and throwing; it
                        is able to do this because we extend our sides out for
                        a total of 17 square foot catcher which feeds into our
                        catapult that has an estimated 150 lbs launch force.
                        Daisy has four meccanum wheels which, in theory, allow
                        it to move in any direction facing forward except for
                        up and down. It is also able to score into the high
                        goal or the low goal.

                        The team’s second year brought more members and a more
                        complex robot. The team had 15 members. This required
                        dividing the team members into sub-teams including
                        mechanical/powerdrive, programming, marketing and
                        logistics. The game was called <i>Ultimate Ascent</i>
                        and involved throwing Frisbees at a target and climbing
                        a pyramid. We participated at the Crossroads Regional
                        in Terre Haute, IN. Although the team didn’t advance to
                        the finals, they took great pride in successfully
                        executing all the game elements. The team also
                        participated in an animation contest with its
                        production of <i>Jack and the Beanstalk</i> featuring
                        our mascot MetalCow and was awarded the 2013 Award for
                        Technical Excellence.

                        Ultimate Ascent is a game styled similarly to disc golf
                        or ultimate frisbee. Robots must pick up or collect
                        disks from feeder stations, and put them into wide
                        goals 10′ off the ground. At the end of the game,
                        robots can climb a metal pyramid to gain more points,
                        with more being awarded for going higher.

                        Chippy was designed with a dropout 2 -pneumatic, 2
                        -omni wheel drive -train that enabled us to quickly
                        service problems, as well as maneuver and drive quickly
                        on the field. We use two pneumatic wheels that launch
                        the disk out into the top goal. At the end of the game,
                        we would latch two hooks on our shooter to the bottom
                        bar to pull up off &nbsp;the ground for a 10 point
                        bonus.

                        The team of 11 members spent 6 weeks in
                        January/February 2012 building a robot to play in the
                        2012 FIRST <i>Rebound Rumble</i> game. The robot was
                        designed to shoot a basketball into the goal, play
                        defense, and balance on a bridge. The first competition
                        was at the Midwest Regional on March 2012 held at the
                        UIC Pavilion in Chicago, IL. The goal going into the
                        competition as a rookie team was to have a running
                        robot. We arrived at the competition with two bags of
                        partially completed assemblies and left with a fully
                        functioning robot that earned us the Rookie Inspiration
                        Award for our efforts and determination to continually
                        build and modify at this competition.

                        Rebound Rumble is a game styled similarly to
                        basketball. Robots must collect basketballs and score
                        them into goals of varying heights (More points for
                        higher goals). Separating the two sides of the field
                        are 3 teeter -totter “bridges”, and a bump. At the end
                        of the game, 10 points are given for each robot
                        balanced on a bridge.

                        Bessie was designed to pick up and score balls into the
                        low goal, and be able to push down the bridge so it
                        could balance on and travel across.
